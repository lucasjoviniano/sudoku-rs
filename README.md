# Sudoku-rs

An Sudoku Solver written in Rust, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM). This program was made with learning purposes.

# How to Use

You'll need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) installed. Installation instructions are available in their pages.

You can edit the Sudoku grid in the `src/main.rs` file. Then, just run `cargo run` on the root folder.
